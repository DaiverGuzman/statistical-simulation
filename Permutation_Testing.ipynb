    "# Permutation testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Permutation testing tries to obtain the distribution of the test statistic under the null **without making any strong assumptions** about the data, as opposed the classical tests like t-test or chi-square test.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps involved:\n",
    "\n",
    "![permutation test](img/permutation_test1.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "A pemutation test is a kind of **non-parametric** test, which only assumes that it is possible for all treatment groups to be very similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider data from two groups, A and B. A permutation test typically involves the following steps:\n",
    "- First we detertmine the test statistic, this could be anything but usually we would like to know the difference in means of two groups,\n",
    "- Next, the observations are pooled and a new dataset is generated for every possible permutation of labels in groups A and B.\n",
    "- In practice, it gets restrictive to look at every permutation, so we use a random sample of possible permutations.\n",
    "- As a next step, we calculate the difference in means of each datasets. This set of calculated differences is the exact distribution of the difference in means under the null hypothesis where the group labels are irrelevant.\n",
    "- As a final step, we can check to see where our test statistic falls in this distribution. For instance, if the test statistic falls within the 95% of the Confidence Interval, we can say that there is no real difference between groups A and B.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could even use this distribution to obtain a p-value if you please.  \n",
    "Thus permutation tests are quite simple and intuituve.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Very flexible\n",
    "- No strict assumptions\n",
    "- Widely acceptable\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Computationlally expensive\n",
    "- Custom coding required\n",

    "\n",
    "Suppose that you are in charge of a non-profit, and are testing two different web page designs for your donation web site.  \n",

As discussed in the video, we want to see if there's any difference in the donations generated by the two designs - A and B. Suppose that you have been running both the versions for a few days and have generated 500 donations on A and 700 donations on B, stored in the variables donations_A and donations_B.\n",
